Visualising Symmetries in the 2D Plane

Using this program:

Installing Processing:
- Visit: https://processing.org/download/ and download the version of processing applicable for your specific operating system

Installing ControlP5 Library
- Visit: http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ 
- Download the controlp5.zip file library from this site.
- Installation: Unzip and extract the file into the processing 'libraries' folder in order to install it. The program will now be able to work.

Current level of implementation:
Out of the 17 existing plane patterns, I have been able to implement the following (12/17):
*442 
442
4*2
2*22
*2222
22*
2222
22x
*x
**
xx
o

Currently working on the more complex patterns that involve more complex calculations in regards to rotation etc. I found that this was rather challenging, and despite developing some frameworks for it, such as a rotatePoint() function, which uses an expanded rotation matrix to rotate points by a given angle. Given that this project is due today :( I will be working on these in my spare time from here on out, but these will not be able to be assessed.
